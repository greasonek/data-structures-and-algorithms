# Code Challenge 32: Tree Intersection

## Emily Greason

### Problem Domain:

- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
- Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

### Testing:

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
  - The function should return an array of common values
  - The function should return an empty array if there are no common values
  - The function should be able to handle a case in which one tree is empty
