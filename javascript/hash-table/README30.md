# Code Challenge 30: Hash Tables

## Author: Emily Greason

### Required Features:

> Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

- set
  - Arguments: key, value
  - Returns: nothing
  - This method should hash the key, and set the key  and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
  - Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
- get
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
- has
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- keys
  - Returns: Collection of keys
- hash
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Index in the collection for that key

### Testing:

1. Setting a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
2. Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
3. Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
4. Successfully returns a list of all unique keys that exist in the hashtable
5. Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
6. Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
7. Successfully hash a key to an in-range value

### WhiteBoard:

#### Class Notes:

- **Hash Tables** - need key value pairs; a way to store data; kind of like an array; o(1) look up time (*in general)
