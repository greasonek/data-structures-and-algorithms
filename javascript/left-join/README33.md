# Code Challenge 33 - Left Join

## Author: Emily Greason

### Problem Domain:

- Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
- The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
- The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
- Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesn’t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic

### Testing

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define
  - Does the function successfully combine two hashmaps
  - Can the function handle an instance where hashmapTwo is empty
  - Can the function handle an instance where hashmapOne is emtpy
